#Python has a number of string functions that are in the string
#library.  We invoke them by appending the function to the string variable.
#They do not modify the original string instead they return a new string that has been altered;

greet = 'Hello Bob'
zap = greet.lower()
print(zap)
print(greet)
print('Hi There' .lower())
