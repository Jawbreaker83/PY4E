The dot character matches any character
If you add the asterisk character, the character is 'any number of times'

e.g.

x-Sieve: CMU Sieve 2.3

X-DSPAM-Result: Innocent

X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475

X-Content-Type-Message-Body: text/plain

"^X.*:""
This expression below says that, starting from the beginning of a line, I am looking for lines that have a capital X at the beginning followed by any number of characters followed by a colon '':''
Will match up with lines that start with x followed by some number of characters followed by a colon
Each of the lines above with produce a true \ match.

A fine tuned variation of the expression above could be

^X-\S+: --> 
Looking for matches that start with an X, followed by a dache, followed by any non-whitespace characters, followed by a greater than or equal to non-blank character follwed by a colon.
